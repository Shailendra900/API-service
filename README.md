## Built with

HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Angular
TypeScript
Rest Countries API# API-service

## What I learned
Another fun project to practice Angular along with API. I have worked with other APIs however mostly with static URLs. This one was a bit harder because I had to change the request depending on the input as well. I am currently working on Search  by country name.

## Users should be able to:

1. Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional).

## Useful resources

1. Rest Countries API - information about countries via a RESTful API
